# EPI uniform extracts of the Current Population Survey
This repository creates cleaned uniform extracts of the CPS basic monthly, outgoing rotation group, and May supplement files.

The data and documentation are available [here](https://microdata.epi.org/).

## Create extracts from scratch
Running `master.do` from the project root loads into memory global macros for the directory structure and the Stata programs used to generate the data and documenation.

Examples of running the Stata programs are at the bottom of `master.do`.
