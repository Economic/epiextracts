`basicwgt` is the sample weight to use for most basic monthly tabulations for ages 16 and above.

It will sum each month to the monthly estimate of the civilian, non-institutional population ages 16 and above. It will replicate most published BLS statistics for 1998 and later [`cmpwgt`](cmpwgt.md).
