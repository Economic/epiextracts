`minsamp` is the month in interview sample (1-8).

CPS respondents are interviewed for four consecutive months (minsamp = 1-4), not interviewd for four months, and then re-interviewed for four consecutive months (minsamp = 5-8). Those in sample months 4 and 8 comprise the outgoing rotation group (ORG) sample.
