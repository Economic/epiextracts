countyfips is the three digit FIPS county code which must be used in conjunction with the state FIPS code.

```eval_rst
.. note::
  In some years, roughly 60% of observations do not have county identifiers. Sometimes very populous counties are not identified with countyfips but will be included as part of a metropolitan area (e.g., Cook County, IL)
```

```eval_rst
.. warning::
  This variable is not consistent over time.
