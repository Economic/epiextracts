Contributing code
===================================
We use git and Github to contribute code. If you'd like to help, check out
our Github repository:

This repository is currently limited to EPI staff --
send an email to Eric or Ben for access

There you can clone our repo, create your own branch of code, and submit pull
requests. If you don't know what that means, read on for a tutorial:
