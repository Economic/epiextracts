Setting up git and Github
========================================
git is all set up for you to use on maynard, but you'll need a free account at `Github <https://github.com/>`_. After you sign up for the free account, you'll need access to EPI's private Github account - ask Ben or Eric for an invitation.

To download or clone EPI's repositories on Github, you'll want to set up SSH access through Github. Ask Ben for assistance, or you can do it yourself following the instructions `here <https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/>`_.
