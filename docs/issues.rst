Feedback
========================================

The best place for feedback or questions
is the Github repository where we host all code:

	https://github.com/Economic/epiextracts_basicorg

That link will only work if you have access to EPI's
private Github account -- for access, ask Eric or Ben.

There you can browse all the code and also ask questions and notify us of
problems. On the repository page, select
`Issues <https://github.com/Economic/epiextracts_basicorg/issues>`_
to browse existing problems and to let us know about a new issue
you're having with the data or documentation.
